## Description

**RainbowArch Linux** is an ArchLinux based penetration testing distribution for
penetration testers and security researchers. The repository contains
[2825 tools](https://www.blackarch.org/tools.html). You can install tools
individually or in groups. BlackArch Linux is compatible with existing Arch
installs. For more information, see the installation instructions.

### Why does RainbowArch exist?

RainbowArch was created after I attempted to report a security issue upstream. Instead of taking the report, noptrix immediately banned me from their Matrix community (before I even sent a single message) and DMd bigoted comments to my friend.

Currently, RainbowArch only tracks BlackArch's commits. RainbowArch is meant to serve as a staging ground between BlackArch packages and [my new OS project](https://0xacab.org/NobodySpecial/lesbiab).

### Philosophy

RainbowArch is openly queer and proudly anti-fascist. If you think wokeness is ruining the world... Yeah, um, this distro probably isn't for you.
